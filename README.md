# CW_PCB_Beacon
Hard-coded digital logic board for morse code LED beacon

## Firstie_Schem

This is a schematic of the board. The voltage regulator is removed, and replaced with simple 5V. Similarly, the J2 jumper for the 9V battery connection is instead replaced with a 5V source.

## Pearce_export_2may

This gerber file was changed slightly to cut down on the amount of vias. There is only one via on the new board. Pay attention to board layers and microcontroller placement.
